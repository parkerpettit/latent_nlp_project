At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room.

Tomatoes are typically found in the fridge or on the countertop. Check:\n  - Fridge 1 (likely)\n  - Countertops 1-4 (less likely but possible)\n\n### Step 2: Cool the Tomato\n- If the tomato is in the fridge, no additional action is needed as it's already cold.\n- If the tomato is not in the fridge, place it in the fridge to cool it down.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the Garbage Can\n- The garbage can is already mentioned as \"garbagecan 1\". This should be easy to find.\n\n### Step 4: Put the Tomato in the Garbage Can\n- Once the tomato is cooled, take it to the garbage can and dispose of it.\n\n### Detailed Plan:\n1. **Check the fridge (Fridge 1)**:\n   - Open the door and look inside for a tomato.\n   - If found, proceed to step 3.\n   \n2. **If no tomato in fridge**:\n   - Check the countertops (Countertop 1-4).\n   - Open each countertop and check if there's a tomato.\n   - If found, place it in the fridge (Fridge 1) to cool it down.\n\n3. **Cool the Tomato**:\n   - If the tomato was in the fridge, it\u2019s already cold.\n   - If placed in the fridge, wait a few minutes for it to cool.\n\n4. **Locate the Garbage Can**:\n   - Find the garbage can (garbagecan 1).\n\n5. **Dispose of the Tomato**:\n   - Take the cooled tomato and place it in the garbage can.\n\n### Final Steps:\n- Ensure the tomato is properly disposed of by closing the lid of the garbage can.\n- You may want to wash your hands after handling the tomato and garbage.\n\nThis plan ensures that the tomato is cooled and properly disposed of in the garbage can.<eop>"
