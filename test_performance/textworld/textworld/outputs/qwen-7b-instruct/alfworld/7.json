At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a garbagecan 1, a sidetable 2, and a sidetable 1.\nYour task is to: put some mug on sidetable.\nNow, you are given a step by step plan as follow: <bop>To complete the task of putting a mug on the side table, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1. **Identify a Mug**:\n   - Look for a mug. Mugs can be found in various places such as the dining table, drawers, or even on the side tables if someone has left one there. Check the dining table first as it's a common place to find mugs.\n\n2. **Locate a Side Table**:\n   - There are two side tables mentioned: sidetable 1 and sidetable 2. Choose one to place the mug on. It doesn't matter which one, but let's choose sidetable 1 for this example.\n\n3. **Reach the Mug**:\n   - If the mug is on the dining table, move closer to the dining table. If it\u2019s in a drawer, open the drawer to find the mug.\n\n4. **Pick Up the Mug**:\n   - Once you have located the mug, carefully pick it up. Ensure it is stable and not easily breakable before moving it.\n\n5. **Place the Mug on the Side Table**:\n   - Walk over to sidetable 1 (or sidetable 2 if you chose that instead).\n   - Gently place the mug on the side table. Make sure it is placed upright and securely so it won\u2019t fall off.\n\n6. **Verify the Task**:\n   - Double-check to ensure the mug is indeed on the side table and stable.\n\n### Detailed Execution\n\n1. **Look for a Mug**:\n   - Quickly glance at the dining table 1. If you see a mug, proceed to step 3. If not, move to the next possible locations.\n\n2. **Check Drawers**:\n   - If the mug isn\u2019t on the dining table, check the drawers (drawer 1, drawer 2, drawer 3, drawer 4). Open each drawer one by one until you find a mug.\n\n3. **Move to Sidetable 1**:\n   - Once you have the mug, walk to sidetable 1.\n\n4. **Place the Mug**:\n   - Place the mug gently on sidetable 1. Ensure it is placed in a visible and accessible location.\n\n5. **Confirm**:\n   - Take a moment to confirm that the mug is indeed on sidetable 1 and is stable.\n\nBy following these steps, you should successfully complete the task of putting a mug on the side table.<eop>"
