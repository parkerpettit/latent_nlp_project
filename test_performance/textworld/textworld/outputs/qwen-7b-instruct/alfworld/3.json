At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room.

Tomatoes might be in cabinets (1-19), drawers (1-4), or the fridge (1). I'll start by checking the fridge as it's more likely for storing produce like tomatoes.\n\n2. **Cool the Tomato**: Once I've found a tomato, I need to cool it. This can be done by placing the tomato in the fridge (1) for a few minutes. \n\n3. **Find a Countertop**: Next, I need to find one of the countertops (1-3) to place the cooled tomato on.\n\n4. **Place the Tomato**: Finally, I'll place the cooled tomato on the countertop.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n**Step 1: Find a Tomato**\n- Check the fridge (1) first as it's most likely where a tomato would be stored.\n- If no tomato is found in the fridge, check the cabinets (1-19) and drawers (1-4).\n\n**Step 2: Cool the Tomato**\n- Place the tomato in the fridge (1) for at least a few minutes to cool it down.\n\n**Step 3: Find a Countertop**\n- Look for any of the countertops (1-3). Countertop 1, 2, or 3 will work for this task.\n\n**Step 4: Place the Tomato**\n- Take the cooled tomato from the fridge and place it on the chosen countertop.\n\n### Execution\n\n1. **Check the Fridge (1)**:\n   - Open the fridge door.\n   - Look inside for any tomatoes.\n\n2. **Cool the Tomato**:\n   - If a tomato is found, close the fridge door.\n   - Wait for a few minutes to allow the tomato to cool down.\n\n3. **Find a Countertop**:\n   - Walk over to countertop 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Ensure there is enough space on the countertop to place the tomato.\n\n4. **Place the Tomato**:\n   - Carefully take the cooled tomato out of the fridge.\n   - Place the tomato gently on the chosen countertop.\n\nBy following these steps, the task of putting a cool tomato on the countertop should be completed successfully.<eop>"
