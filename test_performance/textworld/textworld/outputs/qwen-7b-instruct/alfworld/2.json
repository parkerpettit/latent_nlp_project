At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 2, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 4, a drawer 3, a drawer 2, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.\nYour task is to: cool some plate and put it in cabinet.\nNow, you are given a step by step plan as follow: <bop>To complete this task, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Find a Plate\n- Look for a plate on the dining table (diningtable 1), countertops (countertop 1 or countertop 2), or any other surface where a plate might be placed.\n\n### Step 2: Identify a Cooling Method\n- Since we need to cool the plate, we have several options:\n  - **Refrigerator (fridge 1)**: This would be the most effective way to cool the plate.\n  - **Sinkbasin (sinkbasin 1)**: If there's cold water available, you can rinse the plate and let it cool down.\n  - **Microwave (microwave 1)**: If the plate is made of materials that can be cooled in the microwave, you could use this method. However, this would be less efficient than the refrigerator and may not cool the plate evenly.\n\n### Step 3: Choose the Most Suitable Option\n- Given the options, the refrigerator is the best choice as it will provide a consistent and effective cooling environment.\n\n### Step 4: Cool the Plate\n- Take the plate from its current location and place it in the refrigerator (fridge 1).\n\n### Step 5: Wait for the Plate to Cool Down\n- Allow the plate to cool in the refrigerator until it reaches your desired temperature. This step may take a few minutes depending on how hot the plate was initially.\n\n### Step 6: Put the Plate in the Cabinet\n- Once the plate has cooled sufficiently, take it out of the refrigerator and place it in one of the cabinets (cabinet 1 through cabinet 13). Choose a cabinet that makes sense based on the kitchen layout and organization.\n\n### Summary of Actions:\n1. Find a plate.\n2. Use the refrigerator to cool the plate.\n3. Wait for the plate to cool.\n4. Place the cooled plate in a cabinet.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the task of cooling a plate and putting it away in a cabinet.<eop>"
