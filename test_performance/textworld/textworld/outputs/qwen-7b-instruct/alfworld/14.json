At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room.

We can assume it's somewhere in the room. Let's check the countertops first as they are likely places where food might be kept or prepared.\n\n2. **Locate the Hot Potato:**\n   - Check countertop 1, countertop 2, and countertop 3 for a hot potato. If none are found, proceed to other potential locations such as drawers or cabinets.\n\n3. **Heat the Potato (if necessary):**\n   - If the potato is cold, we'll need to heat it up. We can use the microwave 1 for this purpose. Place the potato in the microwave and heat it according to instructions (usually 30 seconds to 1 minute).\n\n4. **Ensure the Potato is Hot:**\n   - After heating, make sure the potato is hot enough by touching it with your hand or using a thermometer if available.\n\n5. **Find the Fridge:**\n   - Locate fridge 1, which is likely the largest appliance in the room and will be used to store the hot potato.\n\n6. **Put the Hot Potato in the Fridge:**\n   - Carefully place the hot potato in the fridge. Ensure it is placed in an appropriate section of the fridge (e.g., vegetable crisper, fruit compartment) depending on what the potato is.\n\n7. **Close the Fridge Door:**\n   - Make sure the fridge door is closed securely to maintain the temperature inside the fridge.\n\n### Summary of Actions:\n1. Search for a hot potato on countertops.\n2. Heat the potato in microwave 1 if needed.\n3. Verify the potato is hot.\n4. Find fridge 1.\n5. Place the hot potato in the fridge.\n6. Close the fridge door.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to successfully complete the task of putting a hot potato in the fridge.<eop>"
