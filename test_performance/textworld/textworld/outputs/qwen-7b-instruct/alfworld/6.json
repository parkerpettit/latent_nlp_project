You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room.

Locate a tomato:\n   - Tomatoes are not mentioned as being present in the room, so I'll need to search for one among the available items.\n   - Possible locations: fridge (1), cabinets (1-13)\n\n2. Choose a suitable cabinet or fridge to search:\n   - Cabinets are more likely to have fresh produce, but the fridge might also contain tomatoes.\n\n3. Open the chosen container and find a tomato:\n   - If searching the fridge, open the door and check the shelves and drawers.\n   - If searching the cabinets, open each one systematically until a tomato is found.\n\n4. Clean the tomato:\n   - Fill a bowl with cold water from the sinkbasin (1).\n   - Rinse the tomato under running water to remove any dirt or debris.\n   - Gently rub the tomato with your hands to ensure it's clean.\n\n5. Dry the tomato:\n   - Use a clean kitchen towel or paper towel to pat the tomato dry.\n\n6. Place the cleaned tomato on the countertop:\n   - Go to countertop (1) and carefully place the tomato on its surface.\n\n7. Verify the task is complete:\n   - Ensure the tomato is clean and on the countertop as instructed.\n\nThis plan assumes that a tomato can be found among the listed items. If no tomato is present, the task cannot be completed as specified.<eop>"
