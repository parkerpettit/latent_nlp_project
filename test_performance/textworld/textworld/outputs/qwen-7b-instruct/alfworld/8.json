At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room.

Cabinets near the sink or bathroom area would be ideal.\n\n2. **Find a soap bottle**: Look for a soap bottle. It could be in the garbage can, on the countertop, in a drawer, or perhaps already on one of the cabinets. If no soap bottle is immediately visible, check likely places first.\n\n3. **Gather necessary items**:\n   - Soap bottle (if not found)\n   - Water (to fill the bottle if it's empty)\n   - Towel or cloth (for cleaning)\n\n4. **Clean the cabinet surface**: Wipe down the chosen cabinet surface with a clean towel or cloth to ensure it's dust-free and ready for the soap bottle.\n\n5. **Fill the soap bottle** (if needed):\n   - Open the soap dispenser or container and pour the liquid soap into the empty bottle.\n   - Screw on the cap tightly to prevent leaks.\n\n6. **Place the soap bottle on the cabinet**:\n   - Carefully place the filled or empty soap bottle on the cabinet surface.\n   - Ensure it's stable and doesn't wobble.\n\n7. **Label if necessary**: If you want to label the soap bottle, use a permanent marker to write \"SOAP\" or another relevant identifier on the bottle.\n\n8. **Verify placement**: Double-check that the soap bottle is securely placed on the cabinet and easily accessible.\n\nBy following these steps, you should successfully complete the task of putting a soap bottle on a cabinet in the room.<eop>"
