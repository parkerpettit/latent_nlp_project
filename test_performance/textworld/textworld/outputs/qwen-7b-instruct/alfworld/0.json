At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a bed 1, a desk 2, a desk 1, a garbagecan 1, a shelf 5, a shelf 4, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, and a shelf 1.\nYour task is to: look at cd under the desklamp.\nNow, you are given a step by step plan as follow: <bop>To accomplish the task of looking at a CD under a desklamp, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Desklamps**: First, I need to find where the desklamps are located. Desklamps are typically found on desks. There are two desks mentioned: desk 1 and desk 2. I'll start with desk 1.\n\n2. **Check Desk 1**: \n   - Approach desk 1.\n   - Look for a desklamp. Desklamps are usually near the top or side of the desk.\n   - If a desklamp is present, proceed to step 3. If not, move to desk 2.\n\n3. **Check Desk 2**:\n   - Approach desk 2.\n   - Look for a desklamp. Again, desklamps are usually near the top or side of the desk.\n   - If a desklamp is present, proceed to step 4. If not, continue searching for another desklamp in other areas of the room (e.g., shelves, nightstands, etc.).\n\n4. **Look Under the Desklamp**:\n   - Once a desklamp is found, check underneath it.\n   - Look for any CDs that might be placed there.\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - Ensure that no CDs are hidden or obstructed by other items.\n\n6. **Report Findings**:\n   - If a CD is found, describe its appearance and location.\n   - If no CD is found, report that no CD was located under the desklamp.\n\nBy following these steps, I should be able to complete the task of looking at a CD under a desklamp.<eop>"
