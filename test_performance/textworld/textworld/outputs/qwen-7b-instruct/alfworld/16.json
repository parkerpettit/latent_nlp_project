At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. \nFor each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>\nYou are in the middle of a room.

It's not specified where it might be, so I'll check common places like cabinets or countertops.\n\n2. **Check Cabinet 1**:\n   - Open Cabinet 1 to see if there's a spray bottle inside.\n   - If found, proceed to step 3.\n   - If not, move to the next location.\n\n3. **Check Cabinet 2**:\n   - Open Cabinet 2 to see if there's a spray bottle inside.\n   - If found, proceed to step 3.\n   - If not, move to the next location.\n\n4. **Check Cabinet 3**:\n   - Open Cabinet 3 to see if there's a spray bottle inside.\n   - If found, proceed to step 3.\n   - If not, move to the next location.\n\n5. **Check Countertop 1**:\n   - Look for any spray bottles on the countertop.\n   - If found, proceed to step 3.\n   - If not, move to the next location.\n\n6. **Check Garbage Can 1** (as a last resort):\n   - Check if there's a spray bottle in the garbage can.\n   - If found, proceed to step 3.\n   - If not, it's possible that a spray bottle was not present in the described environment.\n\n7. **Move Toward the Toilet**:\n   - Once the spray bottle is located, walk towards the toilet.\n\n8. **Place the Spray Bottle on the Toilet**:\n   - Carefully place the spray bottle on top of the toilet.\n   - Ensure it's stable and won't fall off easily.\n\nIf no spray bottle is found after checking all these locations, it's possible that one was not present in this scenario, and the task cannot be completed as requested.<eop>"
