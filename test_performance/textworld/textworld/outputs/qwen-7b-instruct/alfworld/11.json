Clean the chosen cloth:\n   - Go to the sinkbasin(s) or bathtubbasin to wash the cloth.\n   - Fill the basin with water and add mild soap if needed.\n   - Submerge the cloth in the water and gently rub it to remove dirt or stains.\n   - Rinse the cloth thoroughly under running water until all soap suds are removed.\n   - Squeeze out excess water from the cloth but do not wring it to avoid damaging it.\n\n4. Dry the cloth (if necessary):\n   - Squeeze out any remaining excess water.\n   - Hang the cloth on the handtowelholder or lay it on a clean surface to air dry.\n\n5. Find a suitable drawer:\n   - Choose a drawer that is not already full or cluttered.\n   - Consider using drawer 1, 2, or 3 as they are closer to the sinkbasin and towelholder.\n\n6. Put the cleaned cloth in the drawer:\n   - Open the chosen drawer and carefully place the clean, damp cloth inside.\n   - Ensure the cloth is neatly folded or laid flat to maximize space and maintain organization.\n\n7.
